# Swami-Gokulnedra-Saraswati
🔹A React-based devotional website dedicated to Swami Gokulendra Saraswati, featuring photo sliders, annual puja details, and a clean, responsive design for seekers. 
🔹 Longer README Description:  I’m happy to share that I’ve created a devotional website dedicated to **my Guru, स्वामी गोकुलेन्द्र सरस्वती. 
This website is designed to bring seekers closer to Swamiji by offering:  
📸 **Photo Slider** – A glimpse of Swamiji’s divine presence.
🙏 **Annual & Special Puja Section** – Information on spiritual rituals like *वार्षिक समृद्ध पूजा* .
🌸 **Peaceful UI** – A simple, clean, and responsive React-based design.
The idea behind this project came when I felt the need for an **easily accessible online space** where devotees can connect with Swamiji’s teachings, presence, and blessings — anytime, anywhere. 
💫 For me, this is not just a project — it’s a small offering of love, devotion, and gratitude at Swamiji’s feet. With Swamiji’s grace, this has been possible, and I wish to expand it further by adding more content and features in the future. 
🙏 Please feel free to visit, explore, and share your thoughts. Your feedback will help me make this sacred digital space even more meaningful.
